# Automated-Typing
This Python script utilizes the pyautogui library to automate keyboard input. After a brief delay of 5 seconds, it types "Hello World!" and presses the Enter key a total of 108 times. This can be useful for automating repetitive text entry tasks in any active application or we can call it a tool to send almost annoying messages or spam.
# Features:
1) Easy to Use: Simply run the script and switch to the target application within the 5-second delay.
2) Customization: Modify the text and repetition count as needed
3) Automation: Streamlines repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
